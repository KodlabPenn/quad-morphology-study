# quad-morphology-study
Repo for studying the effect of morphology on behavior in quadrupeds using optimization. Particularly focused on internal degrees of freedom. 

This README is a placeholder for the code and a more indepth description of the algorithms used in "Twisting Spine or Rigid Torso: Exploring Quadrupedal Morphology via
Trajectory Optimization", J. Diego Caporale, Zeyuan Feng, Shane Rozen-Levy, Aja M. Carter, and Daniel E. Koditschek, ICRA 2023.
